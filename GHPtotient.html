    <h2>Euler's Totient Function</h2>
    <p>RSA encryption also uses a mathematical function called the totient function. The totient function is represented by the symbol &phi;. &phi;(n) takes an integer n and finds all integers below n coprime to n. The best way to explain it is by more examples:</p>
    
    <p>&phi;(6) = 2. Think about all the numbers below 6. These numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Now we will count how many of these numbers are coprime to 6. 1 is coprime to all integers, so 1 is coprime to 6. 2 shares a factor with 6, so it is not coprime. 3 shares a factor with 6, so it is not coprime. 4 shares a factor with 6, so it is not coprime. Finally, 5 does not share a factor with 6, so it is coprime. In total, there were 2 numbers that were coprime to 6 and also below 6, so &phi;(6) = 2.</p>
    
    <p>There are certain shortcuts to finding &phi;(n):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>&phi;(p) = (p - 1) when p is a prime. Because all of the numbers below a prime number cannot share a factor with p (if they did, then p wouldn't be prime), every number below p counts towards &phi;(p). There are p - 1 integers that are below p (for obvious reasons).</li>
      <li>&phi;(p<sup>n</sup>) = p<sup>n</sup>-p<sup>(n-1)</sup>. We will use a counting method called counting the opposite. Instead of counting all numbers that are coprime to p<sup>n</sup>, we can count all numbers that are not coprime (and share a factor with p<sup>n</sup>). Let's call this set "Set A." Set A contains multiples of p all the way up to p<sup>n</sup>, which is the last multiple of p. We can write this as {p, 2p, 3p, 4p… p<sup>n</sup>}. Factoring out a p for p<sup>n</sup> gives us (p<sup>(n-1)</sup>)p. Therefore, because each coefficient of p starts at one and increases by one, we can use the last coefficient as a marker for how many terms are in the set. In other words, the first term has a coefficient of 1, the second term has a coefficient of 2, the third term has a coefficient of 3, and the last term has a coefficient of p<sup>(n-1)</sup>. Therefore, we have concluded that there are p<sup>(n-1)</sup> terms that share a factor with p<sup>n</sup>. Subtracting this from the total numbers from 1 to p<sup>n</sup> is represented by p<sup>n</sup> - p<sup>(n-1)</sup>.</li>
      <li>&phi;(pq) = (p-1)(q-1) where p and q are both primes. This number, pq, is called a semiprime because it has two distinct prime factors. The reasoning behind this is similar to above: we will count the opposite. Let's construct two sets, Set A and Set B, with Set A containing all numbers below pq that share a factor of p. Set B will contain all numbers below pq that share a factor of q. Set A will look like this: {p, 2p, 3p, 4p… pq} while Set B will look like {q, 2q, 3q, 4q...pq}. Then we can subtract all of these numbers from the total numbers up to pq. But wait! Why does pq appear in both Set A and Set B? This is because pq is the only number that is less than or equal to pq and share a factor of p and q. If we subtract both sets from the total, we will be subtracting pq twice. Therefore, we need to remember to add one at the end. We will start by taking the total numbers up to pq and subtracting the number of terms in both Set A and Set B. There are pq positive integers up to pq. There are q terms in Set A and p terms in Set B if we look at the coefficients again. Therefore, &phi;(pq) should equal pq - p - q. But we need to add the extra one that was discussed earlier. In conclusion, &phi;(pq) = pq - p - q + 1, and we can factor that to be (p-1)(q-1). The property is extremely important as it establishes the totient function as multiplicative. What does this mean? Well, this means that the &phi;(pq) = &phi;(p) * &phi;(q). This is also important in RSA encryption because one of the steps is to find the totient function of a semiprime, and this is easy to compute given the prime factors of the semiprime because it is simply multiplication. Therefore, the totient function is only easy given the prime factorization, which makes the totient function a one-way function because the totient function relies on prime factorization.

    <p>Below is a programmed version of the totient function in Javascript. Spoiler: there is an explicit rule for the totient function based on the prime factorization of a number, but RSA encryption generally only uses the semiprime totient function formula. The explicit rule is n(1-1/p<sub>1</sub>)(1-1/p<sub>2</sub>)(1-1/p<sub>3</sub>)...(1-1/p<sub>n</sub>), where n is the number and {p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub>,p<sub>3</sub>,...p<sub>n</sub>} is the prime factorization of n. The proof is left as an exercise for the reader. Hint: The sequence of fractions removes certain specific numbers below n. What are these numbers? Also, notice how the formula also corresponds with the various shortcuts listed above.</p>

    <form name ="phiN">
      n = <input type="text" name= "number" value=""><br>
      <input type="button" value="Calculate!" onClick= "phi()">
    </form>

    <p>Why is this important? Why are we even bothering with this? Spoiler alert: some old guy ages ago named Euler found this pretty cool property:
    </p>
    
    <p>a<sup>&phi;(n)</sup> &equiv; 1 (mod n) where a and n are coprime integers. </p>
