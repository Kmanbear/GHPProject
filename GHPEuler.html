    <h2>Euler's Theorem</h2>
    <p>Now we will tackle one of the keys of RSA encryption: Euler's Theorem. Euler was messing around with theorems one day when he decided that he was going to expand on a previous theorem called Fermat's little theorem. He decided to name it after himself (quite self-conceited, but anybody would do that if they stumbled upon a discovery like this). As a reminder, the theorem states that a<sup>&phi;(n)</sup> &equiv; 1 (mod n) where a and n are coprime integers.</p>
    
    <p>The proof starts out by constructing two sets. One set is comprised of all coprime integers to n less than n. Sounds familiar? This is the type of stuff we did above when we were computing &phi;(n), except that &phi;(n) counts the number of numbers in the set. I'll give you a moment to create the set...Time's up! I have created the set {r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>3</sub>...r<sub>&phi;(n)</sub>}.</p>
    
    <p>Next, Euler decided that he wanted to construct a second set with quite amazing properties. He decided to multiply each number in the first set by another number a. This integer must be coprime to n for reasons to be revealed later. Next, he took the products and found the remainder when divided by n. This is represented mathematically by the set {ar<sub>1</sub> mod n, ar<sub>2</sub> mod n, ar<sub>3</sub> mod n...ar<sub>&phi;(n)</sub> mod n}. Let's call this set "Set B." Now we can start to compare "Set A" with "Set B." Here are some observations:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>First of all, both sets have the same amount of terms. We aren't adding any terms or taking any terms out. All we are doing from "Set A" and "Set B" is changing the value of each term. Therefore, the number of terms still remains the same across both sets.</li>
      <li>All terms in "Set B" are distinct. Although this may seem hard to believe at first, we use a method called a "proof by contradiction." We start off by assuming that there are terms in Set B that are the same. Then we will try to tear it to shreds using the power of logic by finding contradictions. Then, we will have proved that it is logically impossible for terms to be the same in Set B. We can start off by writing r<sub>x</sub> &equiv; ar<sub>y</sub> (mod n). Then, we can divide a from both sides of the congruence because a is coprime with n. Now we can see why Euler needed the integer a to be coprime with n. This is to allow division, which is only possible in modulo arithmetics if an inverse can be found. The only way an inverse exists is if a is coprime to n. In the end, we get r<sub>x</sub> &equiv; r<sub>y</sub> (mod n). We know this is a contradiction because both these terms are in Set A. But by definition, Set A does not contain repeat terms. Therefore, Set B does not contain repeat terms either.</li>
      <li>Cue the most ingenious part of the proof: All terms in Set B are coprime to n. Once again, we will do a "proof by contradiction." Let's assume that a term in Set B shares a factor with n and consequently is not coprime with n. That means that ar<sub>n</sub> mod n shares a factor with n. Now we must look back to a characteristic of modular arithmetics: we can rewrite modular arithmetics without the fancy and weird mod notation. Let's do it! We will rewrite ar<sub>n</sub> = kn + r, where k is arbitrary and r = ar<sub>n</sub> mod n. If ar<sub>n</sub> mod n shares a factor with n, then r shares a factor of n. In the equation  ar<sub>n</sub> = kn + r, we can factor out a factor of n from the side kn + r because kn obviously shares a factor of n (it is by definition a multiple of n) and r is assumed to have a factor of n. This doesn't make any sense because we know that a is coprime with n and r<sub>n</sub> is also coprime with n by definition. So we have two integers, one that shares a factor with n and one that doesn't. Yet these two integers are somehow equal to one another. Contradiction! This means that ar<sub>n</sub> mod n cannot share a factor of n and must be coprime with n. ar<sub>n</sub> mod n happens to be all of the terms in Set B, which are proven to be all coprime with n (Conrad).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And now the final steps are ready. We observe that Set B has the same terms of Set A, Set B and Set A have no repeated terms, and the terms in Set B and Set A are all coprime to n. These two sets seem awfully similar. In fact, Euler realized that these two sets contain the exact same terms. If terms in Set B are coprime to n, they must be included in Set A because Set A is the set of ALL numbers coprime to n. Of course, numbers in Set A are less than n, but numbers in Set B are also less than n because they are remainders. In conclusion, Euler noticed that Set B is a permutation (all the terms are the same, but the order may be different) of Set A.</p>
    
    <p>But Euler continues messing around. He decides that the he will multiply all the terms in Set A and all the terms in Set B. These two values are the same because order does not matter in multiplication. This yields ar<sub>1</sub> * ar<sub>2</sub> * ar<sub>3</sub>...ar<sub>&phi;(n)</sub> &equiv; r<sub>1</sub> * r<sub>2</sub> *r<sub>3</sub>...r<sub>&phi;(n)</sub> (mod n). We can factor an a out of the left side to get a<sup>&phi;(n)</sup> * (r<sub>1</sub> * r<sub>2</sub> *r<sub>3</sub>...r<sub>&phi;(n)</sub>) &equiv; r<sub>1</sub> * r<sub>2</sub> *r<sub>3</sub>...r<sub>&phi;(n)</sub> (mod n). The grand finale is dividing the long product of r terms on both sides (you can do this because all of the r's are coprime with n by definition, so an inverse exists), getting the final result:</p>
    <p>a<sup>&phi;(n)</sup> &equiv; 1 (mod n) where a and n are coprime integers.</p>
